# Notes---The-Complete-JavaScript-Course-2019-Build-Real-Projects-
This repository will be for all of the notes I will be taking during the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!"

Likely I will be keeping an index for each section of the course with my corresponding notes. I will also be splitting the sections of the course into their own folders.

Index:

1 - javascript_language_basics (just that, from defining variables to about loops and iteration and everything in between - all of the information I think should be remembered)<br>
2 - javascript_behind_the_scenes<br>
3 - javascript_in_the_browser_DOM_manip_and_events<br>
