# Notes---The-Complete-JavaScript-Course-2019-Build-Real-Projects-
This repository will be for all of the notes I will be taking during the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!"

Likely I will be keeping an index for each section of the course with my corresponding notes. I will also be splitting the sections of the course into their own folders.
