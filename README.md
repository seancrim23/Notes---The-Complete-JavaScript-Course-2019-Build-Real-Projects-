# Notes---The-Complete-JavaScript-Course-2019-Build-Real-Projects-
This repository will be for all of the notes I will be taking during the Udemy course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2019: Build Real Projects!"

Likely I will be keeping an index for each section of the course with my corresponding notes. I will also be splitting the sections of the course into their own folders.

<h3><u>Index</u>:</h3>

<ol>
<li>javascript_language_basics (just that, from defining variables to about loops and iteration and everything in between - all of the information I think should be remembered)</li>
<li>javascript_behind_the_scenes<br></li>
<li>javascript_in_the_browser_DOM_manip_and_events</li>
<li>advanced javascript - objects_and_functions</li>
<li>large budget app project - more advanced javascript</li>
<li>next gen javascript - intro to ES6 / ES2015</li>
</ol>
